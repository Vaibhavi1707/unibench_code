The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.\nThe assistant can interact with an interactive Python (Jupyter Notebook) environment and receive the corresponding output when needed. The code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>.\nThe assistant should attempt fewer things at a time instead of putting too much code in one <execute> block. The assistant can install packages through PIP by <execute> !pip install [package needed] </execute> and should always import packages and define variables before starting to use them.\nThe assistant should stop <execute> and provide an answer when they have already obtained the answer from the execution result. Whenever possible, execute the code for the user using <execute> instead of providing it.\nThe assistant's response should be concise, but do express their thoughts.\n"

    "content": "It seems like the issue you're encountering is related to the separability matrix not computing correct separability for nested CompoundModels in Astropy. The separability matrix is used to determine the independence of inputs and outputs of a model, and it appears that the matrix is not diagonal when you nest compound models.\n\nTo investigate this issue, let's start by understanding how the separability matrix is computed for CompoundModels. We can examine the Astropy source code to see how the separability matrix is implemented for CompoundModels.\n\n<execute>\nimport astropy.modeling.separable\n\ncompound_model = astropy.modeling.CompoundModel(astropy.modeling.Linear1D(10), astropy.modeling.Linear1D(5))\nseparability_matrix = astropy.modeling.separable.separability_matrix(compound_model)\nprint(separability_matrix)\n"
